    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>Our goal at BITS is to help impact the USC community through technology while helping new developers gain a valuable learning experience, and adept programmers some leadership experience. Essentially, members will form teams and work on projects that are intended to impact the life and experience on campus. Ideally, we would like to pair more experienced developers, with ones that have a bit less experience in order to create a more holistic learning environment.  We would like to provide a development space for our members which mirrors the development processes in industry as closely as possible. Furthermore, we want to hold workshops as well as networking events to hopefully get our members acclimated to the tech industry.</p>
    <p>As mentioned above, our main focus is on developing applications that will help the USC community. If you have an idea for an application that you think would help the USC community directly or indirectly, then you can pitch it at the general meeting and see your ideas come to life. We are looking for self motivated individuals to take initiative on projects and meet the deadlines that they set. Email us with more questions!</p>

				<h3>Chris Cognetta</h3>
        <p>Hi, I’m Chris Cognetta. I’m a Computer Science and Business Administration Major at USC. I’m really interested in education, and how we can augment the learning process through technology. As a result, I want to use my mobile app development skills to achieve that goal. Outside of classes, I’m an avid writer and photographer.</p>

				<h3>Nikhil Cherukuri</h3>
  			<p>Hi, I am Nikhil Cherukuri. I’m a Computer Science major in my senior year. I interned with Siemens PLM Software this past summer and developed two virtual reality CAD viewers on the Google Daydream and Microsoft Hololens Platforms. Apart from that, I have done some research in AI and Machine Learning with the Teamcore research Lab at USC and was a Course Producer for CS 170. I’m looking to use my development experience to help others enhance their resume.</p>

				<h3>Kyle Tan</h3>
        <p>My name is Kyle Tan and I’m a senior studying CE/CS at USC. As an engineer, I am particularly interested in iOS and Web Development, but I’m also fascinated about many different hardware and their interactions with their software components. This year I am a CISCO campus ambassador for USC and look forward to bridging the skills and connections I gained at CISCO, to what we do here in school.</p>
