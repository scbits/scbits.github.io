    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>This semester we are going to collaborate with our members to come up with new innovative ideas to impact the USC community! As a relatively new club, we are excited to have our new members pave the way for the potentially ongoing years in BITs’ future. Down below are some basic project ideas that we as e-board have come up with, but in the future we would like to populate it with projects our new members have crafted. Members can either choose to work on an idea already out on the table, or suggest new projects and we can organize teams around those as well!</p>

    <br> </br>
    <h5>Here are some of our projects:</h5>


      <div>
				<h3>Club Searching</h3>
        <p>Rather than going through the hassle of involvement fair, we aim to create a web application that will allow students to fill out a profile and search for existing student orgs based on their preferences. Not only will this be potentially as effective as a career fair, but this online application will last indefinitely whereas a career fair is only a couple hours long- plus, who likes going out nowadays.</p>
      </div>

			<div>
				<h3>Textbook Exchange</h3>
				<p>The current system for exchanging textbooks on Facebook has drawbacks, such as a poor response rate, unreliable transactions and general inconvenience. This is because Facebook isn’t really catered for textbook exchanging. We aim to remedy this problem by allowing students to sell their books on a platform specific to exchanging books for classes. A user will be able to search for the class they want, and see the list of all books required/related to that class and see who is selling those specific ones. Sellers can request money, or other things if specified. As an extra feature, we would also support e-books as well in this implementation.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Rate my Club</h3>
				<p>The concept for this application is kind of like a Rate My Professor, only for clubs at USC. Registered clubs would be added onto the server and partitioned into subsets based on the school the club is under, as well as other classifications (e.g. recreational clubs, academic clubs, outdoor clubs etc.) Users will be able to access a particular club based on these criteria and rate it/comment on it. Similar to Rate My Professor, the rating will go from 1 to 5 based on an attendants experience at an event/GM or a members experience from regularly attending meetings.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Cheat Sheet Maker</h3>
				<p>This relatively simple Web application is designed to help students who usually take notes online, create a printable cheat sheet for an exam. A user will upload his/her notes onto the system and specify the length of the cheat sheet (1 sheet, 2 sheets, half a sheet etc.) and the application will manipulate the spacing and size of the information so that it fits into the specified size. As an additional feature, these notes that are uploaded can be posted onto a public online board that can be viewed by others to help them study for that particular class. Because Trojans help Trojans!</p>
